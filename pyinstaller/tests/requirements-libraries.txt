# PyQt5 and add-on packages
# We do not pin *-Qt5 packages (which contain Qt shared libraries), as Qt5 is not actively developed
# anymore, and thus 5.15.x has a stable ABI. Plus, it seems that *-Qt5 5.15.2 wheels are available for
# all platforms, while 5.15.11 are available only for macOS (and some of them only for arm64).

# The *-Qt6 packages contain Qt shared libraries; their version is therefore the version of Qt release,
# but in contrast to Qt5 and PyQt5 bindings, the versions here must usually be kept in sync with the
# version of corresponding PyQt bindings packages. That is because Qt6 is under active development, and
# thus the ABI is still changing.
